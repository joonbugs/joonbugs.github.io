Hi there! I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University's [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu) (CMU HCII). I focus on research at the intersection of accessibility ([A11y](https://www.a11yproject.com)), disability studies, computer vision applications, and interface and controls [IxD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design) for computer and robotic systems.

I'm currently a member of [AXLE Lab](https://axle-lab.com) in HCII, where I'm currently exploring and designing trust-embodying informatics display designs and controls for an autonomous wheelchair.

I've had the privilege of being guided in my research journey by incredible advisors such as _(in reverse-chronological order)_: [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com), [Amy Pavel](https://amypavel.com), [Jeffrey Bigham](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/), [Vincent Aleven](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aleven/), and [Illah R. Nourbakhsh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~illah/).

Outside of research, I'm passionate about issues of equitable access for persons with disabilities, particularly with education. In my off time, I freelance as a video/music producer/ and play a mix of drums and piano.
