I am an undergraduate senior at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) majoring in AI and minoring in HCI. My studies are supported by [CMU's Presidential Scholarship.](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/scholarships-and-grants/university.html) I am advised by [Patrick 
Carrington](https://www.patrickcarrington.com) for my senior honors thesis, and a member of [AXLE Lab](https://axle-lab.com) in the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute.](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu)

My research interests are at the intersection of accessibility (A11y), disability studies, applications of machine learning methods, and effective modalities of conveying and organizing information.
