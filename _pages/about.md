Hi there! ✌️ I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu), which is a part of Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. 

I conduct research at the intersection of accessibility ([A11y](https://www.a11yproject.com)), disability studies, computer vision applications, and [IxD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design) for computer and robotic systems. I'm currently a member of [AXLE Lab](https://axle-lab.com).


Outside of research, I'm passionate about issues of equitable access for persons with disabilities, particularly with education. **If you self-identify as a person with a disability and are thinking about issues of academic access for pwd or starting research, let's chat!** In my off time, I freelance as a video/music producer and play a mix of drums and piano.

I've had the privilege of being guided in my research journey by incredible advisors such as _(in reverse-chronological order)_: [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com), [Amy Pavel](https://amypavel.com), [Jeffrey Bigham](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/), [Vincent Aleven](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aleven/), and [Illah R. Nourbakhsh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~illah/).
