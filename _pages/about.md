I'm an undergraduate senior at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) majoring in AI and minoring in HCI, applying for a Ph.D this application cycle. My studies are supported by [CMU's Presidential Scholarship](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/scholarships-and-grants/university.html).

My research interests are at the intersection of accessibility ([A11y](https://www.a11yproject.com)), disability studies, applications of ML methods, and interface and controls interaction design for computer and robotic systems. I'm interested in pursuing a Ph.D. to conduct further research in topics relating to innovations in interactive experiences and controls, particularly advancements which may have an impact to persons with disabilities.

I'm advised by [Patrick Carrington](https://www.patrickcarrington.com) for my senior honors thesis, and a member of [AXLE Lab](https://axle-lab.com) in the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu), where I'm currently exploring and designing trust-embodying informatics display designs and controls for an autonomous wheelchair.

I've had the privilege of being guided in my research journey by passionate advisors such as _(in reverse-chronological order)_: [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com), [Amy Pavel](https://amypavel.com), [Jeff Bigham](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jbigham/), [Vincent Aleven](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aleven/), and [Illah Nourbakhsh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~illah/).

Outside of research, I'm passionate about issues of equitable access, particularly for persons with disabilities in the context of education. In my off time, I find myself absorbed with music performance (drums/percussion/violin) and production.
