About Me
======
I'm an undergraduate senior at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in AI and minoring in HCI. My studies are supported by [CMU's Presidential Scholarship.](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/scholarships-and-grants/university.html)

My research interests are at the intersection of accessibility, disability studies, applications of machine learning methods, and effective modalities of conveying and organizing information.
